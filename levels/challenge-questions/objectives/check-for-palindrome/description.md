It looks like this part of the forge is responsible for generating power and distributing to the rest of the system. This particular terminal ensures the forge has a constant flow of pur palindromic power by stabilizing all signals that pass through the system.

Create a function `isPalindrome` that accepts a string. This function should return a boolean (true/false) based on whether or not the string is spelled the same forwards and backwards. There are a couple of ways you should modify the input string.

- Lowercase the string
- Remove spaces

## Examples

- `tacocat` -> `true`
- `""` -> `true`
- `heLLo` -> `false`
- `Never odd or even` -> `true`
