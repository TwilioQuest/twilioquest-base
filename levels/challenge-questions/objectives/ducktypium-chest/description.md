Cedric has been exploring a temple in search for the Dark Ducktypium Chest, but hasn’t had any luck. His O.W.L.(Object Waypoint Locator) unit has led him to this room, with a door impeding any further progress. There’s a lever that when pulled, opens the path. The only issue is that the lever rises again if he lets it go, causing the door to quickly slam shut. What should Cedric do to overcome this obstacle? The valid instructions are `race the lever`, `break barrels and pots`, `give up`, and `kick the door`. Each of these will tell Cedric to perform an action.

For example, to tell Cedric to try and kick the door down you would enter the string: `kick the door`.
