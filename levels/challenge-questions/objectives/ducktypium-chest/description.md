Cedric has been exploring a temple in search of the Dark Ducktypium Chest, but hasn’t had any luck. His O.W.L.(Object Waypoint Locator) unit has led him to this room, with a door impeding further progress. The door has several engravings of words and symbols. After performing a topography scan, here are the results that Credric got back:

`skrept` = `door = open`
`jah` = `if`
`vuh` = `lever === pulled`

You must put the words in the correct order for Credric to continue his journey. The valid inputs are `skrept`, `jah`, and `vuh`.
