Cedric has stumbled across some jars scattered in an otherwise empty hallway. His O.W.L. unit is once again indicating that there's something worth checking out in one of these jars. However, it also warns that the other jars are trapped.

![A hallway with 3 white and green jars, 2 terracotta jars, and 1 gray jar](<%= imagePath %>)

The O.W.L. unit has collected a lot of random information about the jars. Help Cedric figure out which jar color to smash.

- There are three colors of jar `white and green`, `terracotta`, and `gray`.
- The most plentiful jar is at most 100 years old.
- The least plentiful jar's paint is starting to peel.
- The terracotta jars are cracking with age.
- The newest jar is trapped.
- Jars with peeling paint are between 200 and 300 years old.
- Jars with cracks are at least 500 years old.
- The oldest jar is also trapped.

Enter the color of jar that is not trapped so Cedric can smash it, click the _HACK_ button!
