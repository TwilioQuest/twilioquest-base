It looks like this part of the forge is responsible for generating power and distributing it to the rest of the system. This particular terminal ensures the power generator has a balanced fuel mixture.

Create a function `balanceBrackets` that accepts an array of brackets. This function should return a boolean (true/false) based on whether or not the array of brackets is balanced.
