    Could you remind me who you are, and what you do on the ship?

        That's absolutely right. It kind of emerged from Twitch chat, and it
        stuck. You should <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/coreylweathers">hang out on the stream sometime</a>.
        Chat can fill you in on the details.

        Theoretically, yes. In reality, not really. Our navigational shields are 
        functioning normally, but our deflector shields and weapons systems are 
        completely offline. I'm working with Ryan and the engineers back at base
        to patch these systems, but I don't have an ETA on that work.<br/><br/>
        Try not to start any trouble before then, alright?

        I'm Corey, security and tactical officer aboard the Fog Owl. If
        there's trouble, that's when I go to work. Hopefully, I won't go to
        work that often.

        Operator, always a pleasure. What can I do for you?
