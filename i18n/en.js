  "fog_owl.cedric.about_tq_main": `The #[span.highlight TwilioQuest] program is a top-secret organization 
  dedicated to exploring and safeguarding the wild frontier of The Cloud.
  #[span.highlight Operators] in the TwilioQuest program - people like you - are at the
  forefront of this important mission.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_tq_legacy_systems": `Unfortunately, we know very little about the specific plans and membership of
  the #[span.red Legacy Systems]. We do know they are a vast network of 
  powerful individuals, always seeking to protect their hoarded wealth and 
  influence. Until recently, they had been content to operate from the shadows.
  Now, their operations grow bolder and more brazen every day.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_tq_legacy_systems_bolder": `It seems not a day goes by without a new security breach, social media
  misinformation campaign, or abuse of privileged data access. These acts
  may seem random, but our intelligence indicates they are connected. We
  believe this is only the beginning of a larger offensive by the 
  #[span.red Legacy Systems].`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_tq_legacy_systems_do": `We will respond by swelling the ranks of the #[span.highlight Operators].
  The more people we have exploring The Cloud, adhering 
  to #[span.highlight The Operator's Code],
  the better our chances of stamping out the influence of the 
  #[span.red Legacy Systems]. Even in the vastness of The Cloud, we will
  ensure there is no dark corner where the Legacy Systems can hide.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_tq_history": `In the year 2013, the TwilioQuest program trained a handful of developers, 
  the #[span.highlight First Operators], to take up the tools of software development in a 
  mission to save The Cloud. Today, advances in cloud exploration 
  technology allow us to further scale our recruitment efforts. This is
  most fortunate, as the #[span.red Legacy Systems] seem to be gaining strength at the
  same time.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_tq_first_operators_text": `You will get your chance to meet them in due time. But before that can happen,
  the Fog Owl must be made ready for exploration, and you must focus on
  your Operator training.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_tq_first_operators_speech": `You will get your chance to meet them in due time. But before that can happen,
  the Fawg Owl must be made ready for exploration, and you must focus on
  your Operator training.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_tq_operator": `Operators are not part of a formal command structure, and have no
  responsibilities as such. However, to be considered an Operator
  and receive the support of the TwilioQuest program, members must
  adhere to the #[span.highlight Operator's Code].`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_tq_code_text": `Operators are sworn to use their abilities only to write code that
  promotes #[span.highlight hope, power, and freedom] for all of humanity.
  Those that write code used to steal, oppress, or deceive
  cannot be called Operators. Intentionally or not, developers who use
  their skills in this way have become part of the 
  #[span.red Legacy Systems].`,

  cannot be called Operators. Intentionally or not, developers who use

  "fog_owl.cedric.about_twilio_what": `Using Twilio APIs, your software applications can communicate over many
  different channels, including SMS, WhatsApp, video, voice, fax, email,
  and others. Twilio also provides higher level tools for use
  cases like contact centers, two-factor authentication, and A.I. bots.
  You can learn how to use these APIs through the training exercises in 
  the #[span.highlight VR Training Room].`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_twilio_name": `The name "Twilio" has no other meaning. It was chosen by the founders
  because of its brevity, and the availability of a dot com domain of the same
  name. It was assumed that a day would come where the company would
  change its name. That day never arrived.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_twilio_brief": "I am happy to tell you what I know.",
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_twilio_main": `#[a(href="https://www.twilio.com") Twilio] is a provider of 
  communications APIs and infrastructure based in San Francisco, California.
  Twilio is the primary sponsor of the TwilioQuest program, although officially,
  they disavow any knowledge of our clandestine activities.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_world_everyone_else": `Other Internet users are indeed present in The Cloud, but the interfaces
  they use to perceive it are not as advanced as yours. While they live
  and work in the virtual worlds of The Cloud, most Internet users view
  these worlds as if through a keyhole.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_world_responsibility": `Educating the public about The Cloud is important, but consider the following.
  Do you know how water flows through your faucet, or how an engine moves
  a train along the tracks? We trust that those who contribute these
  wonders to our world keep our safety and best interest in mind. Such
  is our responsibility as we build virtual worlds in The Cloud.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_world_space": `Just so. The enormity of space, and the ability to traverse it
  in a ship, are concepts your brain knows how to interpret. Your neural
  interface uses these metaphors to allow you to more easily explore and
  understand the virtual worlds of The Cloud.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.about_world_cloud_text": `You are "literally" in The Cloud in the ...millenial... sense of the word?
  Your physical body is still located in the real world, but you have
  formed a #[span.highlight direct neural connection] to The Cloud. This enables you to
  interpret data from The Cloud at incredibly high speeds, presented

  "fog_owl.cedric.about_you_main_speech": `I am flattered by your interest! As you know, my name is 
  Cedric, and I have been assigned as your personal 
  assistant and executive officer aboard the Fawg Owl.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.robot": `Not precisely. I am a virtual intelligence program, currently 
  executing on multiple servers in datacenters distributed across the 
  Earth. However, it is frequently useful to appear in The Cloud or 
  the real world in a physical form. The "robot" you see in front of you 
  is my avatar in this world. I currently use a Misty II chassis from
  #[a(href="https://www.mistyrobotics.com/") Misty Robotics] for this purpose.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.fun": `I wish I could say. While my programming is advanced in many 
  respects, I lack a strong understanding of the human experience. I 
  know the meaning of words like "fun", but I do not truly understand 
  them.`,
  "fog_owl.cedric.sad_text_p1": `In an attempt to better understand humanity, I have joined a 
  variety of social media platforms. Recently, I created a YouTube

  stuck. You should <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cldubya">hang out on the stream sometime</a>.
  Chat can fill you in on the details.`,
  "fog_owl.corey.defensive_systems": `Theoretically, yes. In reality, not really. Our navigational shields are 
  functioning normally, but our deflector shields and weapons systems are 
  completely offline. I'm working with Ryan and the engineers back at base
  to patch these systems, but I don't have an ETA on that work.<br/><br/>
  Try not to start any trouble before then, alright?`,
  "fog_owl.corey.about": `I'm Corey, security and tactical officer aboard the Fog Owl. If
  there's trouble, that's when I go to work. Hopefully, I won't go to

  "fog_owl.craig.whats_this_response": "What is this area of the ship used for?",
  "fog_owl.craig.dossier": `That's true! I did spend time in the Peace Corps teaching computer skills 
  in Guyana. It's incredible how much technology has advanced since then.
  It would have been much easier with a direct neural interface to The 
  Cloud, that's for sure.`,
  "fog_owl.craig.whats_this": `This is the latest in educational technology from the TwilioQuest Program.
  It's a virtual reality training simulator! To use it, walk up to the terminal

  finally allow us to stay one step ahead of the Legacy Systems.`,
  "fog_owl.marcus.dossier": `Hah, they put that in there did they? In addition to my fine technical 
  skills, I do take pride in my excellent diction. And knowing word 
  origins is more useful than you might think.`,
  "fog_owl.marcus.about": `Sure thing. Marcus, chief engineer aboard the Fog Owl. I make sure our 
  bird keeps singing, and right now it's a beautiful tune. I'll let you

  ride is much cooler than any junker the Air Force has in the fleet.`,
  "fog_owl.megan.traffic": `A few, but nothing I can't handle. Once you survive driving in Los Angeles,
  killer bit comets and narrow logic gates become much less initimidating.`,
  "fog_owl.megan.about": `You bet. I'm Megan, and I have the privilege of serving as
